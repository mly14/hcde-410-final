Abstract

The Urban Heat Island effect is when cities are hotter than surrounding areas. It's calculated by finding the difference between the temperature inside and outside a city. I became interested in researching this topic after learning about it in an environmental science class. In my project, I analyzed a dataset that contains Census Tract information to answer 2 questions:
Which counties have the largest daytime temperature difference? Do these counties have the largest nighttime temperature difference?
What is the correlation between the daytime UHI effect and demographic factors like income, age, and race?
The dataset I'm using comes from a study published in American Geophysical Union. 

I found that the top 5 counties during the day are in Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, New Jersey, and Rhode Island. For these counties, I also calculated the correlation coefficient between temperature, income, race, and age. I found that income had the strongest correlation out of all the factors. I created visualizations to convey my findings. More research needs to be done to explain the physical processes that cause certain areas to be hotter.
