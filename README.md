For my final project, I will analyze a dataset to see if there are correlations between a city's demographics and its temperature to study the effect of the urban heat island (UHI) effect. Climate change is a big problem that exacerbates the UHI effect. I became interested in this topic after learning about it in an environmental science class. The dataset I'm using comes a study published on American Geophysical Union. 

I came up with 3 research questions to determine what populations and regions are exposed to the highest temperatures. 

1. How strong is the correlation in cities that have strong correlation between income and temperatures?
2. Which counties have the highest correlation between age/race/education and temperature? Is one factor stronger than the others?
3. Which counties have the largest daytime temperature difference? Which counties have the largest nighttime temperature difference?

To answer these questions, I will perform quantitaive data anlysis and for a couple of them, create some visualizations to showcase my findings.
