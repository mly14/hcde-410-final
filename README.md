The goal of this project is to analyze temperature and Census data for different counties in the US to observe the impact of the urban heat island effect. 

The [source data](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/1F72FB) comes from a [research paper](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2021EF002016) published on the American Geophysical Union. It is under the CC0 1.0 Universal  (CC0 1.0) Public Domain license so I can use it freely without needing permission.
